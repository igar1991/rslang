# RSLang Technology Stack

Technologies used to build the app: 

- **React** for creating user interface. Mostly we choose React due to the reusable components, high performance and interactivity.
- **React Router** to make a single-page application with navigation without the refreshing.
- **Redux Toolkit** for the state managmenet of our application. It's simplify store setup, reducer creations and creating slices.
- **RTK Query** as a part of *Redux Toolkit* to manage work with API and caching data.
- **Typescript** to make our code more predictable and typed ;) 
- **MUI** with some custom changes to make our design more interesting.
- **ESLint** with rules for React hooks and Typescript. It helps to prevent the issues on building stage (even if you are not recognize that it would be a bug).
- **Husky** to run linter automatically on commit and prevent invalid commit messages.
- **apexcharts** to create a beautiful chart for statistics
